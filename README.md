Custom Artificial Intelligence (AI - Machine and Deep Learning) is a service of <b>Executive Information Portal (EIP)</b> for each legal entity. It serves as a REST API to available <b>Kafka topics and private PersonaDB</b> for data processing, and "outside-in services" custom-made for the legal entity to address identified [ <b>pain points / dukkha-dukkha</b> ] in Making Life Easier and Happier. It relies on proven scientific knowledge in "<b>Modeling, Simulation, Machine and Deep Learning</b>". Typical example is the entity's custom Feed taking into account not only <b>Relevance</b> similar to LinkedIn "FollowFeed" but also <b>Intelligence</b> based on normative rating of one's "<b>Right Effort</b>" in [ <b>Plan &gt;&lt; Execution &gt;&lt; Feedback</b> ] from Buddhist "<a href="https://aeon.co/essays/the-logic-of-buddhist-philosophy-goes-beyond-simple-truth" target="_blank">beyond true and false</a>" of "<a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/finger-pointing-to-moon.html#Section_2" target="_blank">Thing-As-It-Is</a>" and one's strategic position to change oneself and the environment in evolutionary "<b>Change Management</b>".

Deliverable and measurable <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/nature-of-things.html#Section_2.1" target="_blank">consciousness technologies</a> will be available to enable one the center of all activities and relationships in reclaiming one's innate [ "<i>Buddha Nature / Kingdom of God fron within / Ultimate (Wider) Truth / Perfected Nature / Consciousness of the consciousness / There is No god but God</i>" ] toward <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/references.html#R23" target="_blank">What Count</a>. Open source technologies and world markets are available to any <b>breakthrough</b> you can contribute in making your life Easier and Happier since there are many like you who may benefit from your "<b>secret sauce</b>" and/or value-add to your contributions. We will lower the barrier of entry to enable many being parts of this new <b>Era of Conscious Living</b> in wider markets of <b>Dependent Nature</b>. AI can only be tools directed by human cultivable <b>Conscience</b> (consciousness of the Right and Wrong) in Value of the values in one's <a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/right-mindfulness.html#Section_2" target="_blank">Continuity of the Consciousness</a>

Thanks to Internet and market competition, many proven technologies tested by the giants are Freely available and continuously improved by developers in open-source communities. For example, LinkedIn FollowFeed is a part of topics in donated Kafka streaming. Similarly, Google LevelDB was improved by Facebook into open-source RocksDB. We stay at the <b>bare-metal inspired by LevelDB written in Golang</b>, and use donated additional improvements such as its incomplete official implementation in Go, BadgerDB, Spanner, etc, to put our efforts in integration of proven areas such as Prometheus Time Series, Git CoW (Copy on Write), Cloudevents in the Green Field of cultivable and measurable "<a href="https://blog.khaiphong.io/2017/12/selfselfless-dualityoneness.html#Section_2" target="_blank">No-Conflict Consciousness</a>", perpendicular to the <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/" target="_blank">duality plane of conflicting consciousness</a> (Relative Truth) in daily activities. Deliverable outcomes will be released at the right time for further public contributions.
